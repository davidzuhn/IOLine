 * IOLine implements a generic interface to multiple types of I/O lines
 *
 * Currently implemented I/O line types include Arduino pins (D0-D13,
 * A0-A5, etc), MCP23017 based IOX lines (attached via I2C interface),
 * and virtual lines that have no electronic interface but have a local 
 * state maintained in software.
